# How big is the complexity for training and classifying?

# O(nd+kn)
# https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/219655/k-nn-computational-complexity
# KNN: O(nd+kn) (We hae to calc the distance per n points. Then you have to sort the distances and then)

# Least squares regression!!
# O(d^2)

# O(nd^2)

# O(md)
# summing over the dot product m times

# KNN O(nd) and SVM O(md)
# O(10000 * 256) 2560000
