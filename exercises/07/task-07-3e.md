# Task 07-3e

## Question

Do you think that the Eigenfaces algorithm could be used for automatic passport control (checking a photo of a person against the biometric photo in her passport)? Explain.

## Answer

It is possible to use Eigenfaces as a picture comparison method for faces. Because of the use of biometric face image captuing standards like ISO19794-5 and the properties of Eigenfaces, the comparison is mainly invariant to small changes or brightness. The comparison might be enhanced by selecting the best test image of a set of images, like capturing an amount of images per time and take one which is suitable for comparison.
